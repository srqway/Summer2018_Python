This is a test.  I want to see if YOU can tell me how many UPPERCASE LETTERS, 
lowercase letters, nUmbERs, and spaces ArE in this document.  I would also 
like you to tell me HOW many conSONAnts and vowels are in here. 
VowelS aRe considered A, E, I, O, and U.  Do not count Y.  
If you can aCCuraTely get ThIs coRRect you would likely get a 20 out of 20, which is a 100.
I am hOpInG you can do that.  If yOu have issues, PLEASE let me know.  Submit the code as there
is no nEEd for you to do pSeudoCode.  You can CrEaTe if you wish, but you are NOT requireD.  0 1 2 
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 are the DigiTs to account for.  

Thanks,

Paul
